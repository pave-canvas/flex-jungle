			<description><![CDATA[<p>The toppings you may chose for that TV dinner pizza slice when you forgot to shop for foods, the paint you may slap on your face to impress the new boss is your business. But what about your daily bread? Design comps, layouts, wireframes—will your clients accept that you go about things the facile way?

Not so fast, I'd say, there are some redeeming factors in favor of greeking text, as its use is merely the symptom of a worse problem to take into consideration.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Credibly empower enterprise wide mindshare for excellent “outside the box” thinking. Proactively scape day meta services rather than enterprise results.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span>We offer a range of training packages in a range of subject areas and can offer blended learning opportunities to best meet your needs. If sitting in a room with a trainer and having the opportunity for discussion with other learners sounds good to you then we can offer this. If you have enough people wanting to attend the same course then we can run one just for you. If you prefer to study in your own time and at your own speed then one of our e learning packages may be right up your street. There is a third option, which is like the sound of both but perhaps can’t attend all training sessions, this is when blended learning comes into its own.</span></p>
